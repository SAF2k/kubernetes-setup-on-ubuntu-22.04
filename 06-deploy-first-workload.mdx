# 🚀 Deploy Your First Kubernetes Workload

Now that your cluster control plane is set up and the pod network is installed, it's time to deploy your first workload.

---

## 📦 Step 1: Create a Deployment

Create a simple Nginx deployment using kubectl:

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

## 📍 Step 2: Verify the Deployment

Check the status of your deployment and pods:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
```

You should see your Nginx pod running.

## 🌐 Step 3: Expose the Deployment

Expose your deployment as a service to make it accessible:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
```

## 🔍 Step 4: Check the Service

List your services and note the NodePort assigned:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

Access the service by visiting   

```bash
http://<node-ip>:<node-port>
```

Replace `<node-ip>` with your node's IP and `<node-port>` with the port from the previous step.

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You've successfully deployed your first application on Kubernetes!
