# 🧱 Kubernetes Setup on Ubuntu 22.04  
## Page 1: Initial System Preparation

This section outlines the foundational steps to prepare your Ubuntu 22.04 nodes before Kubernetes installation. These steps apply to both control plane and worker nodes.

---

## 📌 Overview

In this phase, we will:

- Set hostnames and update the `/etc/hosts` file  
- Configure system timezone and time synchronization  
- Disable swap permanently  
- Install essential networking and system packages  
- Set kernel parameters required by Kubernetes

---

## 🖥️ Step 1: Set the Hostname

Each node in your Kubernetes cluster should have a unique, meaningful hostname.

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <your-node-hostname>
```

> Replace `&lt;your-node-hostname&gt;` with something like `cp-node-1`, `worker-1`, etc.

---

## 🗂️ Step 2: Configure `/etc/hosts`

Append all node IPs and hostnames to the `/etc/hosts` file so they can resolve each other within the private network.

```bash
sudo tee -a /etc/hosts <<EOF

# Control Plane Nodes
10.x.x.11   cp-node-1
10.x.x.12   cp-node-2
10.x.x.13   cp-node-3

# Worker Nodes
10.x.x.21   worker-node-1
10.x.x.22   worker-node-2

# Optional: Monitoring, Storage, GitLab, etc.
10.x.x.31   monitor-node-1
10.x.x.41   storage-node-1

EOF
```

> ⚠️ Update the IPs and hostnames to reflect your actual network configuration.

---

## ⏰ Step 3: Configure Timezone and Time Sync (Chrony)

Accurate time sync is critical for cluster coordination.

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install chrony -y

sudo systemctl enable chrony
sudo systemctl restart chrony

# Set system timezone
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata
```

---

## 📦 Step 4: Install Required System Packages

Install tools that are required for further configuration and Kubernetes setup.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gpg \
  software-properties-common vim git wget
```

---

## 🚫 Step 5: Disable Swap (Required by Kubernetes)

Kubernetes does **not support swap**, so disable it:

```bash
sudo sed -i '/swap.img/s/^/#/g' /etc/fstab
sudo swapoff -a
```

We'll automate swap disabling at boot in a later section.

---

## 🌐 Step 6: Configure Kernel Networking Parameters

Enable the required networking options for Kubernetes pods and services:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/kubernetes.conf <<EOF
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
EOF

# Apply the settings immediately
sudo sysctl --system
```

---

## ✅ Summary

At this stage, your system is:

- Named and networked correctly  
- Using accurate time via Chrony  
- Updated and prepared with necessary packages  
- Swap is disabled  
- Kernel networking is ready for Kubernetes
