After deploying your first workload, it's important to know how to scale and update your applications smoothly.

## 🔧 Scaling a Deployment

To scale your deployment to 3 replicas, run:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=3
```

Check the updated pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

## 🚀 Rolling Updates

Update your deployment's image to a newer version:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/nginx nginx=nginx:1.21.1
```

Monitor the rollout status:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx
```

## ⏪ Rollback if Needed

If an update causes issues, rollback to the previous version:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx
```

## 🧹 Clean Up

To delete your deployment and service:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment nginx
kubectl delete service nginx
```
