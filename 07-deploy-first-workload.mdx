# 🚀 Step 5: Deploy Your First Workload

With your Kubernetes cluster set up and the pod network installed, it's time to deploy a simple application.

## 📝 Create an NGINX Deployment

Create a deployment with the official NGINX image:

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

## 🚀 Expose the Deployment

Expose it as a service on port 80:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
```

## 🔍 Verify Deployment and Service

Check the pods status:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Check the service details and port:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

## 🔗 Access the NGINX Server

Use the Node IP and the assigned NodePort to access your NGINX server via browser or curl.
