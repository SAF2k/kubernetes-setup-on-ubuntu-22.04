# 🚀 Step 5: Deploy Your First Kubernetes Workload

Now that your cluster is ready with networking, let’s deploy a simple app to test it.

---

## 🧪 Deploy a Nginx Web Server

Run the following command on your control plane node (`cp-node-1`):

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

This creates a deployment named `nginx` running the official Nginx container image.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Check Deployment Status

Verify the deployment and pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
```

You should see the `nginx` deployment with one pod in `Running` status.

---

## 🌐 Expose the Deployment

To access the Nginx server, expose it as a service:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
```

This exposes the deployment on a random port on all nodes.

---

## 🔍 Find the NodePort

Get the service details to find the port assigned:

```bash
kubectl get svc nginx
```

Look for the `NodePort` value under the `PORT(S)` column (e.g., `80:31234/TCP`).

---

## 🌍 Access the Nginx Server

Open your browser and navigate to:

```bash
http://<node-ip>:<node-port>
```

Replace `<node-ip>` with your node's IP and `<node-port>` with the port from the previous step.

You should see the Nginx welcome page.

---

## ✅ Clean Up (Optional)

To delete the deployment and service:

```bash
kubectl delete service nginx
kubectl delete deployment nginx
```
