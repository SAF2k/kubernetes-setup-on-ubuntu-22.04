# 🧭 Step 3: Initialize the Kubernetes Control Plane

In this step, you'll use `kubeadm` to initialize the Kubernetes cluster from the control plane node.

> ✅ **Tip**: Replace `<your-node-hostname>` with names like `cp-node-1`, `worker-1`, etc., to keep things clear.

---

## 📍 On the Control Plane Node (`cp-node-1`)

Run the following command:

```bash
sudo kubeadm init \
  --apiserver-advertise-address=192.168.56.110 \
  --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```

### 🔍 Explanation

- `--apiserver-advertise-address`: This is the IP address of your control plane node.
- `--pod-network-cidr`: Required for the Pod network. For example, Flannel uses `10.244.0.0/16`.

## 🖥️ Example Output

You should see output ending like this:

```bash
Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

---

## 🛠 Configure kubectl Access

Now copy the `admin.conf` to your user's `.kube` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

Once done, test access using:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see the control plane node in a `NotReady` state—this is expected because the pod network is not yet installed.

---

## 🔧 What kubeadm Did

- Created `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/` containing static pod definitions for:
  - `kube-apiserver`
  - `kube-controller-manager`
  - `kube-scheduler`
- Set up a working etcd and control plane environment.
- Generated all required certificates.

---

## ⏭ Next Step

Now that the control plane is ready, let's install a **Pod network plugin**.
