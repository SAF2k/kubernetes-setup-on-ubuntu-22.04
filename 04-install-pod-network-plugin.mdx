# 🌐 Step 4: Install a Pod Network Plugin

After the Kubernetes control plane is initialized, the cluster nodes can’t communicate until a Pod network plugin is installed.

---

## Why is this necessary?

Kubernetes requires a network plugin to allow Pods running on different nodes to communicate with each other. Without it, nodes will stay in `NotReady` status.

---

## 🔧 Installing Flannel (Recommended)

Flannel is a simple and widely used network plugin for Kubernetes.

Run this command **on the control plane node (`cp-node-1`)**:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```

---

## 🖥️ Verify the Pod Network Plugin

Check if the `kube-flannel` pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide | grep flannel
```

Wait for all Flannel pods to be in `Running` status.

---

## ✅ Check Node Status

After Flannel is running, your nodes should transition to `Ready` state.

Verify nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- If nodes remain `NotReady` for a long time:
  - Check the Flannel pod logs:  
```bash
  kubectl logs -n kube-system <flannel-pod-name>
  ```
  - Verify firewall rules or network policies aren’t blocking traffic.

---

## ⏭ Next Steps

Your Kubernetes cluster is now operational with a network plugin installed.

Next, you can:

- Deploy your first workloads.
- Set up cluster add-ons (metrics-server, dashboard).
- Configure storage classes for persistent storage.
